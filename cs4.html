                        During the Winter 2020 recruiting season, I had the chance to complete the Google Design Challenge of their UX Design Internship selection. Out of two prompts, the prompt I chose revolved around wanting to create an experience that helps students report
                        different maintenance and facility issues around their school or campus.

                        Looking back at the project now, there are a lot of design decisions I disliked, and ideas I wanted to incorporate, with a more thought out process. I wanted to completely redesign my experience (UpKeep) from Winter 2020 and remake it the term (Fall 2020).

                        Through user research, I was able to realize the many holes in the reporting process. For example, many students don’t have the know-how of who or where to report to. In addition, any reporting or communication had to be done via phone or email. This
                        provided an excellent opportunity for me to delve into the problem.

                        Before we start to solve anything, we want to be able to break down the key information to get to the its root causes. This included which campus facilities would be targeted, what the current reporting process and mediums are like. In addition, I did
                        some further research onto the information provided by my university and other university maintenance departments.

                        We want to be able to make it easier to report maintenance or repair issues. However, we must ask about the current reporting process and whether students know about the reporting process. Through my research, I found that there is simply a disconnect
                        between the student and the idea of reporting an issue in general.

                        In addition to conducting preliminary research, I spoke with many students and staff about the issue. In short, many students simply do not want to report on-campus issues. Staff noted that the current process to manage reports was quite cumbersome and
                        tedious, but was manageable with how few reports are sent.

                        Having conversations with campus students and staff members, I synthesized potential problem areas and pain points involved with the current reporting process. Students found the process too confusing, staff needed a better way to manage reports, while
                        dispatch did not require such change. I also decided to include maintenance workers as a possible pathway.

                        Ultimately, speaking with students and staff made realize this was a two-faced solution. However, since few reports were coming in to begin with, I decided on the following mission statement to help increase relevant incident reporting and shift focus
                        to just students. We can achieve this with the following goals in mind below.

                        After creating the UpKeep experience for enhancing the way students and staff alike report maintenance repair issues on campus, I believe it is important to look back at our original problem statement and solution and see how we could leverage our implement
                        technologies into our problem.

                        Using Google's own resources, Google Maps already provides excellent location and landmarking within schools and universities. Since the initial experience utilizes some sort of mapping technology, we can always leverage Google Maps as a tool to showcase
                        the maintenance issues and reports in-progress on the map.

                        In addition, we can leverage and even integrate technology like Google Crowdsource to better improve the landmark tracing when reporting issues. This would help UpKeep automatically find your location quicker so that your reporting becomes even more seamless.

                        maintenance issues and failure.
