                        In the beginning of my Winter 2021 term at WSIB Innovation Lab, the Lab's first project was to research, design, and implement a fully functioning chatbot proof of concept (POC) for visitors to the WSIB website.

                        This concept was proposed to us by internal WSIB as a means of connecting users to information regarding claims, insurance billing, and other key information. Our team came up with the concept Botler, which focused on quick interactions and accessibility.

                        The current WSIB website does an excellent job at presenting key claims related information, whether that be for injured workers, businesses, and health care providers. However, from the most common questions users seem to be concerned with the claims
                        process and want to know the intricacies and stipulations involved with a claim. Below are the key navigation options provided.

                        to be many nested menues on the lower levels of the architecture, and lot's of links. This may prove to be cumbersome for the user.
