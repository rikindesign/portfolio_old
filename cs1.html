                        Ingredient scanning with a live camera view was an idea we had from the beginning but never implemented. With this in mind, I wanted to explore how Augmented Reality (AR) technology could ease the 3 pain points mentioned above. Since I had never designed

                        All of the designs and applications I had explored had a minimal amount of controls on screen with tutorials on how to use key features. In addition, interactions with onscreen items were very fast and simple. Onboarding was essential since we need a
                        way to transition current and new users.

                        With the research and key learnings found, I had the following goals in mind when implementing these AR features. These also take into account the 4 ideas mentioned in the brief.

                            <li>I want to use the AR Camera feature to identify items</li>
                            <li>I want to add many ingredients at once instead of taking pictures</li>
                            <li>I want to adjust the quantity of all of my ingredients in one place</li>
                        </ol>

                    <div class="regular">
                        The first idea I had was to incorporate <em>'Ingredient Tags.'</em> Hovering over items helps the camera recognize ingredients and food items marked with small tags. Clicking on these ingredient tags allows the user to view and
                        add the item to their list. The user could also adjust the quantity of their ingredients at once.

                        additions.

                        Version 2 — I alleviated the screen real-estate issue by having a minimized state for each tag. That way, adding an ingredient would have you tap once to maximize the tag, and tap again to add it. The added ingredient would have check mark on the minimized
                        tag to help the user differentiate between already added food items.
